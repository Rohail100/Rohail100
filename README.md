I’m a Full Stack Software Developer with 5+ years of experience in building and deploying scalable web applications using React, Node.js, Next.js, Nest.js, and Django. I’ve led full project lifecycles — from backend API design to cloud deployment on AWS — and recently developed AI-powered tools that use GenAI and Machine Learning for intelligent automation.

I’m passionate about solving complex problems with clean, efficient code and modern technologies. I’d love the opportunity to contribute to your team and help deliver impactful solutions.
